# Dark Star Engine

DarkStar is a WIP cross-platform 2D game engine for my personal projects. Obviously, is not commercial ready. While I'm learning, the engine will work as a Static Library, but the idea is to move it to a Shared Library.

## Components
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for building.
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for windows, graphics and input management.

## TODOs (not in a particular order after the Setup)

- [x] Setup Project
- [x] Initial Window
- [ ] Set up a proper Game Loop
- [ ] Set up an Asset Management
- [ ] Set up the Logging System
- [ ] Set up the Physics System
- [ ] Set up the Memory Manager
- [ ] Switch to Shared Library
